# Jindosh

A code to solve Jindosh's Riddle in Dishonored 2.

The code was built with a riddle with fixed data. The game generates new riddles
for each playthrough, so the code should be updated using variables instead of
hardcoded names. The [riddle text](enigme.txt) (in french) was saved so
replacing all the names is still possible.
